    <h1>ANIME IS FUN!!</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aɲime] <a href="rando.com">(listen)</a> is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from
        Japan. Outside of Japan and in English, anime refers to Japanese animation, and refers specifically to animation
        produced in Japan.[1] However, in Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English
        word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Animation produced outside of Japan
        with similar style to Japanese animation is commonly referred to as anime-influenced animation.

        The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with
        the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience.
        Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet.
        In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video
        games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.

        Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent
        technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and
        individualistic techniques.[2] Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on
        movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle
        shots.[2] Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common
        characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.[3]

    <h2>
        Etymology
    </h2>
    <hr>

    <p>
        As a type of animation, anime is an art form that comprises many genres found in other mediums; it is sometimes
        mistakenly classified as a genre itself.[5] In Japanese, the term anime is used to refer to all animated works,
        regardless of style or origin.[6] English-language dictionaries typically define anime[7] as "a
        style of Japanese animation"[8] or as "a style of animation originating in Japan".[9] Other definitions are
        based on origin, making production in Japan a requisite for a work to be considered "anime".[10]

        History
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>
        Precursors
    </h3>
    <p>
        Emakimono and kagee are considered precursors of Japanese animation.[16] Emakimono was common in the eleventh
        century. Traveling storytellers narrated legends and anecdotes while the emakimono was unrolled from the right
        to left with chronological order, as a moving panorama.[16] Kagee was popular during the Edo period and
        originated from the shadows play of China.[16] Magic lanterns from the Netherlands were also popular in the
        eighteenth century.[16] The paper play called Kamishibai surged in the twelfth century and remained popular in
        the street theater until the 1930s.[16] Puppets of the bunraku theater and ukiyo-e prints are considered
        ancestors of characters of most Japanese animations.[16] Finally, mangas were a heavy inspiration for anime.
        Cartoonists Kitzawa Rakuten and Okamoto Ippei used film elements in their strips.[16]

    <h3>
        Pioneers
    </h3>

    <p>
        Animation in Japan began in the early 20th century, when filmmakers started to experiment with techniques
        pioneered in France, Germany, the United States, and Russia.[11] A claim for the earliest Japanese animation is
        Katsudō Shashin (c.1907),[17] a private work by an unknown creator.[18] In 1917, the first professional and
        publicly displayed works began to appear; animators such as Ōten Shimokawa, Seitarō Kitayama, and Jun'ichi
        Kōuchi (considered the "fathers of anime") produced numerous films, the oldest surviving of which is Kōuchi's
        Namakura Gatana.[19] Many early works were lost with the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse in the 1923 Great
        Kantō earthquake.[20]
